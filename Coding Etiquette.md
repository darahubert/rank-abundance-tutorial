# Coding Etiquette 

The coding ettiquette outlined below aims to make the code for Challenge 1 clear, consistent and easy for others to follow or contribute to. 

For more information see the [Coding Club Etiquette Tutorial](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/etiquette/)

---
## 1. Repository organisation :detective:
The repository should:

 * Contain files that are sensibly named and saved in the correct folder (E.g scripts to be saved in the script folder). 
 * Contain script files that have names ending as .R
 
---
## 2. Script organisation :tada:
Script should:

* Be organised into logical steps that include short sections - grouped according to the code purpose and separated using  ---
* Each section should have an introductory comment that summarises the purpose. 
* Informative comments should be regularly included. 
* Begin with the author name, contact details and date. 
* Contain a list of libraries used. 
---
## 3. Coding syntax :drum:

Code should:

* Include sensibly named variables and datasets.  
* Include a space before the first parentheses when using a function call. 
* Be written in a way that makes it easy to read. Specifically, two extra spaces should be added between the code and  inline comments AND, functions should be     separated onto different lines.  
* Be limited to ~80 characters per line. 

---
## 4. Comments and feedback :loudspeaker:

* Constructive feedback is always welcome :)
* Any feedback and amendments should be polite.
